## Welcome

This site is designed to provide guidance, scripts and resources for sites transitioning data to OMOP common data model as part of CURE ID.

CURE ID is a platform designed and developed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Translational Sciences (NCATS) to capture real world data (RWD) about how existing drugs are used in new ways (e.g., drug repurposing) to treat diseases of high unmet clinical need. The documentation on this site is part of a project funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)'s Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (under Interagency Agreement #75F40121S35006) to develop and disseminate tools facilitating the extraction of RWD from the electronic health record (EHR).

## Collaborative OMOP Concept Mapping Process

1.  CureID clinical informaticists work with each site to manually map internal concepts to OMOP concepts outlined for capture in the project plan.

2.  The combined concepts from all sites are maintained as a single, updated concept set using the OHDSI ATLAS open-source tool.

3.  All concepts currently identified by the work between CureID staff and each site, and all corresponding descendant concepts are exported from ATLAS as .json or .csv files for use in cohort creation, profiling, and clinical registry submission.
